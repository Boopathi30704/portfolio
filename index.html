          <p>I completed my SSLC (Secondary School Leaving Certificate) at Sri Gayatri Higher Secondary School in the
            year 2020. I secured a total of 377 marks, which gave me a strong foundation in fundamental subjects and
            prepared me for my higher secondary education.
            This phase of my academic journey was essential in shaping my interest in mathematics and science, setting
            the groundwork for my future studies in the Maths-Biology group during higher secondary and later, my degree
            in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>
